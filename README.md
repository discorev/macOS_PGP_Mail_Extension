# GPGMail Extension
This is a mail extension using the new mail APIs in macOS Monterey to interact with the GPG Suite GPG command line wrapper.

It's a work-in progress and currently supports decrytion / signature validation as well as encrytion / signing of emails.

Because it uses the offical API it should be supported between OS versions without delay.

This project is not a part of, not indorsed by GPGTools and does not make use of their source code for their GPGMail plugin.
